# Customer-Sentiment-Classifier
Understanding how customers feel about a product or service is one of the most powerful tools for any business. Reviews, comments, and feedback provide a direct window into customer experiences—but going through them manually is slow, repetitive, and impractical.

The Customer Sentiment Classifier is a project built to solve this challenge. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, it automatically analyzes customer reviews and categorizes them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This makes it easier to identify what’s working well, what needs improvement, and how customers truly perceive a brand.

🔍 What this project does

1. Cleans and preprocesses raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

2. Extracts meaningful features using TF-IDF vectorization

3. Trains machine learning/deep learning models for classification

4. Evaluates performance and provides visual insights

🌍 Where it can be applied

1. E-commerce product reviews

2. Social media feedback

3. Customer support tickets

4. Online surveys & user research

🎯 Goal

To create a reliable and scalable sentiment analysis system that turns raw customer feedback into clear, actionable insights for better decision-making.
